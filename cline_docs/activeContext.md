# Active Context

## Current Status
The Interactive Map Application is fully functional with all core features implemented. The system allows users to add pins to a map, create connections between pins, and view real-time updates through an activity feed.

## Recent Changes
1. Enhanced Polling System (1.2.2025)
   - Implemented polling mechanism for real-time updates
   - Added PollingManager class for generic polling functionality
   - Set 2-second interval for pin and connection updates
   - Maintains popup states during updates
   - Synchronizes both pins and their connections
   - Improved type safety with TypeScript interfaces

2. Memory Bank Initialization (1.2.2025)
   - Created comprehensive documentation structure
   - Documented system architecture and patterns
   - Captured current progress and planned features

## System State
1. Frontend
   - TypeScript application with Leaflet.js map integration
   - Manager-based architecture for different concerns
   - Real-time updates via Server-Sent Events

2. Backend
   - Flask server running on port 5002
   - File-based storage for pins and connections
   - Geocoding and Giphy API integrations

3. Active Features
   - Interactive map with pin creation
   - Connection management between pins
   - Real-time activity feed with polling updates
   - Automatic location geocoding
   - GIF integration support
   - Full synchronization between browsers (pins and connections)
   - Persistent popup states during updates

## Current Focus
1. Documentation
   - System architecture documentation
   - Technical implementation details
   - Progress tracking
   - Development setup instructions

2. Stability
   - Monitoring system performance
   - Tracking user interactions
   - Error handling improvements

## Next Steps
1. Short Term
   - Monitor system performance with current implementation
   - Gather user feedback on current features
   - Address any immediate issues or bugs

2. Medium Term
   - Implement marker clustering for better performance
   - Enhance mobile responsiveness
   - Improve error handling and recovery

3. Long Term
   - Add search and filtering capabilities
   - Implement user preferences
   - Add offline support
   - Enhance connection visualizations

## Notes
- System is currently stable and functioning as expected
- Memory Bank documentation is complete and up-to-date
- All core features are implemented and working
- Focus is on monitoring and improvement rather than new feature development
