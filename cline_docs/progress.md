## Known Issues
1. Performance with many connections
   - Large number of animated hearts can impact performance
   - Need to implement connection culling

2. Mobile UX Improvements
   - Touch interactions need refinement
   - Small screen layout optimizations needed

3. Error Handling
   - Network error recovery needs improvement
   - Better feedback for failed operations

4. Asset Management
   - Environment-specific path handling needs monitoring
   - Build process optimization for large assets
   - Cache management strategy needed

## Next Steps
1. Implement marker clustering
2. Enhance mobile experience
3. Add search and filtering capabilities
4. Improve error handling and recovery
5. Optimize performance for large datasets
6. Implement asset caching strategy
